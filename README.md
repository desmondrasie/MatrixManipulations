# GRID.java
This file contains a working method "dropAt" that allows the user to manipulate a matrix by adding values to it, in a similar fashion to the game "Connect 4". A value is selected, and dropped into a selected column, filling up from top to bottom.

#Assignment1.java
This file contains several methods that evaluate a matrix similar to a topographic map. These methods can determine whether a value is a lowest point, is a highest point, and can even rotate the matrix by 90 degrees.
